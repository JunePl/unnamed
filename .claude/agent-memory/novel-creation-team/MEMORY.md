# Novel Creation Team Memory

## Project: Unnamed Fantasy/Mystery Novel (奥里斯塔尼世界)

### Key File Locations & Sizes
- WorldBible/世界通鉴.md: 5481 lines, V0.5
- Characters/人设集.md: 1371 lines, V0.5
- Outline/小说节奏规划.md: 799 lines, V1.3
- Cases/案件与伏笔集.md: 1052 lines, V2.2
- Volumes/第一卷.md: 3177 lines, V2.0 (Ch1-50 only, Ch51-100 MISSING)
- 正文/Mian.novel: ~356 lines (early draft, NOT canonical)

### Critical Unresolved Conflicts (as of 2026-02-09)
1. **Dmitri spirit type**: 织命·人脉型 (persona/cases) vs 噬暗·亡灵型 (world bible ch8)
2. **Kassarin politics**: 三执政制 (cases/chapters) vs 三顾问制 (world bible ch8)
3. **Adrian spirit type**: 铸魂·军团型 (crown table) vs 炬焰·灼烧型 (ch4 Eirik details)
4. **Goblins in 正文**: No non-human races in world bible
5. **正文 is DRAFT ONLY**: Skips Ch1-2, tone mismatch, wrong terminology

### World Bible Structure Notes
- Part 1-7: Core systems (spirit contracts, tiers, combat, collapse, etc.) - generally consistent
- Part 3: 天秤 rankings - CANONICAL reference for character rankings
- Part 8+: National details - OLDER VERSION, has conflicts with Part 3 rankings
- The 柱位百杰 table (Line ~2953-2961) should be treated as ground truth for character rankings

### Frozen Items
- World bible Part 8 (Kassarin details)
- All 正文 writing
- Ch51-100 chapter blueprints
- Non-human race decisions

### What Works Well
- Case designs (画商之死, 伯爵之死, 血夜围猎) are excellent
- Character profiles have good depth (language genes, OOC zones, emotional progress bars)
- Foreshadowing debt management (P01-P45) is thorough
- Three-prism writing method executed well in world bible
- Emotion curve verification in chapter blueprints

### Key Architectural Decisions
- 5 volumes, 100 chapters each, ~25万字 per volume
- D-mode as through-line mystery connecting all cases
- Agnes (阿涅丝) dark line: subtle breadcrumbs across volumes
- Leoric (莱奥里克) only appears via letters until Ch90
- Gray endings (case 2) as deliberate design choice
